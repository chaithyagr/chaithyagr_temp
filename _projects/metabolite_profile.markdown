Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy is an effective tool which can be used to measure concentrations of metabolites in various brain regions. This has wide applications in disease modeling and treatment due to which it is really important that this is brought into a clinical setting as soon as possible. To ensure this, the data from MRS must be reflected with reliability indicators and the results must be standardized. Also there is a need to form a baseline of such concentrations so that we have a comparative measure to quantify changes in brain. Once this is done, the results could be used in assessing which concentrations of metabolites in brain regions could have higher correlation to a particular health condition and thus can be used to analyze how effective it is in being a robust bio-marker.
