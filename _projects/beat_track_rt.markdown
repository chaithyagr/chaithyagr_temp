Tracking beats while listening to music is an innate ability of humans. It is expressed in the form of tapping and clapping. Previously, there have been several non-causal attempts to mimic this action. Algorithmic beat tracking is a challenge for real-time implementation. We implement a causal beat tracking algorithm which includes onset detection, Beats Per Minute (BPM) estimation, beat phase estimation and beat prediction. In addition, we propose a novel cost function for beat prediction. The entire algorithm is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 and creative light displays are used to highlight the underlying beat structure in music.
